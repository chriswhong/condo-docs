# Navigation Menu

Configuring this menu allows you to add, remove, and rearrange the content in the navigation of the page.

You can make changes to this menu by logging in to the admin dashboard and navigating to the Settings page in the Collections sidebar. Once there, simply select Menu.

## Menu Components

Each top level Menu Item is comprised of 2 components, a Name and a Menu.

The **Name** of the item is what displays in the top level of the navigation menu. The value also correlates with the Menu name you would use to add a documentation entry to the menu. See [Organizing Documentation](/configuration/organizing-documentation/) for more about adding entries to the menu.

The **Menu** of the item is a text list of sub-Menu Items delimited by a comma. These values correlate to the name of the documentation entry that is placed under this Menu Item.

For example, given the Getting Started menu in the screenshot above, we would see the following values in a Menu Item:

* **Name:** Getting Started
* **Menu:** Manual Installation

To add a new top level Menu Item, select the **Add menu items** option in the Menu Items panel.
